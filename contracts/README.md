# README for Aleph Zero Smart Contract: ZeroRep

## Overview

ZeroRep is a smart contract designed for the Aleph Zero blockchain, leveraging the power of Substrate and the ink! smart contract language to manage a decentralized reputation system. It is tailored to moderate content and assign reputation scores to user-generated posts within a decentralized application. The contract utilizes cryptographic techniques, including Merkle trees and nullifiers, to ensure privacy and integrity of the reputation scores and moderation actions.

## Features

- **Moderation Action Mapping**: A structure to map moderation actions with unique identifiers, facilitating the tracking and management of moderation activities.
- **Data-to-Labels Mapping**: A mechanism to associate files with nullifiers of labels, linking data with its reputation-related labels securely.
- **Reputation Assignment**: Allows a moderator oracle to assign reputation scores to posts, updating the contract's internal mappings to reflect these scores.

## Functions

### Constructor

- `new()`: Initializes the contract with empty mappings for moderation actions and data-to-label mappings.

### User Interaction

- `add_user()`: (Placeholder) A method for adding new users to the system. The implementation details are yet to be defined.

### Post Management

- `add_post(data: Hash, nullifier: Vec<u8>, label_val: String)`: Associates a post with a nullifier and label value, updating the data-to-labels mapping to include this new association.

- `get_nullifiers(data: Hash) -> Vec<(Vec<u8>, String)>`: Retrieves the nullifiers and label values associated with a given piece of data.

### Reputation Management

- `add_reputation()`: (Placeholder) Intended for the moderator oracle to assign reputation scores to specific posts. This function is yet to be implemented.

- `verify_reputation(_nullifier: Hash) -> bool`: (Simplified example) Verifies if the reputation associated with a given nullifier meets a predefined threshold. Currently, it returns a static `true` value, indicating a successful verification regardless of the input.

## Development Notes

- **TODO Items**: The contract outlines several areas for further development, including the construction of a Merkle tree for enhanced privacy and security, and the implementation of a moderation action mapping to track and manage moderation activities effectively.

- **Security Considerations**: As with any smart contract, careful attention must be paid to security aspects, especially given the sensitive nature of reputation management and moderation. Developers are encouraged to thoroughly test and audit the contract's functionality and security mechanisms.

## Conclusion

ZeroRep represents an innovative approach to decentralized reputation and moderation within the Aleph Zero ecosystem. Its design leverages advanced cryptographic techniques to maintain privacy and security while providing a flexible framework for managing user-generated content and reputation scores. As the contract evolves, it will offer a robust tool for decentralized applications seeking to implement effective moderation and reputation systems.
